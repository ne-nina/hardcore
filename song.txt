Here our soldiers stand
From all around the world
Waiting in a line
To hear the battle cry
All are gathered here
Victory is near
The sound will fill the hall
Bringing power to us all

We alone are fighting
For metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight
We're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel
Will never dry
Stand and fight together
Beneath the battle sky

Brothers everywhere
Raise your hands into the air
We're warriors
Warriors of the world
Like thunder from the sky
Sworn to fight and die
We're warriors
Warriors of the world

Many stand against us
But they will never win
We said we would return
And here we are again
To bring them all destruction
Suffering and pain
We are the hammer of the gods
We are thunder, wind and rain

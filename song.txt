Here our soldiers stand
From all around the world
Waiting in a line
To hear the battle cry
All are gathered here
Victory is near
The sound will fill the hall
Bringing power to us all

We alone are fighting
For metal that is true
We own the right to live the fight
We're here for all of you
Now swear the blood upon your steel
Will never dry
Stand and fight together
Beneath the battle sky
